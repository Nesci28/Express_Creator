# Express App Generator

Save hundred of thousands of hours (ok just kidding...) but some documentation research here and there and some time, for a tedious job which is creating a new Express App with the necessary dependancies. This CLI tool will ask you the questions and generate an App depending on the answers.

```
to install: npm install -g express-creator
command to run: ec || express-creator
```
